    """
    This function takes in 3 strings str1, str2 and str3, and returns 
    a string that contains the common characters shared by str1, str2 
    and str3. If a character appears more than once in str1, str2, or 
    str3, it will only appear once in the returned string.
    
    You are expected to use the get_common_characters() function from 
    lab_2_util.py to help you implement this function.
    
    For example, if str1 is "ABBCDE", str2 is "ABBC" and str3 is "ABBD",
    then this function should return "AB".

    This function takes in 3 strings str1, str2 and str3, and returns

    two conditions:
        - The character must be contained in str1.
        - The character must be contained in either str2 or str3.
    
    For example, if str1 is "ABCDE", str2 is "ABC" and str3 is "ABD",
